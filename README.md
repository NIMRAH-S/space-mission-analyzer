# 🚀 Space Mission Analyzer

A GUI-based Python application that analyzes and visualizes space mission data using **Tkinter**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Scikit-learn**.

> 🔍 Load your CSV dataset, view mission statistics, visualize company performance, and run a linear regression on yearly missions – all in one interactive desktop app!

---

## 📦 Features

- 📂 **Load CSV File** – Easily load space mission datasets.
- 📊 **Descriptive Statistics** – Total missions, unique companies, mission success/failure count, and average rocket cost.
- 📈 **Probability Analysis** – Calculate success and failure probabilities.
- 🍕 **Pie Chart** – Top 10 companies by number of launches.
- 📉 **Bar Chart** – Success vs Failure outcomes.
- 🔮 **Linear Regression** – Missions per year with 95% confidence interval.

## 📁 Dataset

The application is built using a cleaned CSV file:  
`Space_Corrected.csv` – contains historical space mission data including:

- `Company Name`
- `Datum`
- `Status Mission`
- `Rocket` (Cost)
